High Level Description
-----

Our project is a simple AI that chats with the user and makes responses based on the conservation. Our main goal for the AI is to have it analyze the conversation and adapt to it so it may respond appropriately. For example, based on the userâ€™s speech, the AI will shift itself toward a personality, such as Good, if the user is friendly, and Hostile, if the user is unfriendly.
